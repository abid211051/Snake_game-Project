# snake_game
My 1st university simple project with python pygame module.

Here i provided my code with presentation and all the asset used in this project.

you have to reinitialize the file path of all this mp3, and jpg file from your computer to run the code. And i used pycharm for python flexibility

e.g   -->  bg_img1 = pygame.image.load("IMAGE PATH FROM YOUR PC")
